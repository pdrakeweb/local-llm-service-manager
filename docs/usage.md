# Usage

## First run: the setup wizard

The setup wizard runs automatically on first launch. It is a 10-step
checklist; steps execute in order, each showing live state
(queued → running → done, or failed with retry). A progress bar tracks
overall completion with elapsed time and ETA. You can also run any step
individually.

| # | Step | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Detect hardware/drivers | GPU inventory, driver version, CUDA compatibility, port availability |
| 2 | Install llama.cpp CUDA build | Downloads the pinned cuda-12.4 build, verifies SHA-256 |
| 3 | Configure tensor-split | Computes per-model GPU splits from discovered VRAM |
| 4 | Download models + verify | 4 curated GGUFs (planner, coder, coder-fast, tool-runner); pause/resume/cancel; checksum before install |
| 5 | Start LiteLLM gateway | Sets up the managed Python environment, generates `config.yaml`, starts `:4000` |
| 6 | Install VS Code extensions | Continue.dev + Cline (pinned), configured against `:4000` |
| 7 | Configure MCP servers | GitHub + Google Drive servers; checks credential presence (values never displayed) |
| 8 | Register Windows ML backend | Probes `WinMLServer`; registers one small model as a secondary backend |
| 9 | Apply MXC policies | Writes the default sandbox policy; Learning mode recommended first; runs a harmless self-test |
| 10 | Smoke-test inference | One test request per backend through the gateway; records baseline latencies |

**Failed steps** show the last log lines inline with *Retry*, *Open full log*,
and *Skip with note*. **Show commands** on any step expands the exact
commands, URLs, checksums, and file paths with copy buttons.
**Mark as manually installed** records anything you set up yourself so the
wizard stops trying to manage it.

**Re-run audit** (wizard finish screen, Dashboard, or Settings) re-executes
all checks without reinstalling: re-verifies prerequisites, re-checksums
models and the llama.cpp build, re-probes backend health, re-validates ports
and config. If an audit finds a checksum mismatch it offers to re-download —
it never reinstalls unprompted.

## Main windows

- **Dashboard** — health-at-a-glance: service cards, GPU strip, model
  placement, 24h throughput. The toolbar's *View* selector switches the same
  data between Appliance (default), Console (dense tables), and Topology
  (node map) presentations; the choice persists per window.
- **Service Map** — the full cluster topology: clients → gateway → backends
  → GPUs → models, with the MXC sandbox boundary and a live event timeline.
- **GPUs** — per-GPU gauges and history; Console view adds process
  attribution and tensor-split detail.
- **Backend detail** — per-backend stats, latency charts, health-check
  history, server flags; start/stop/restart; Test-request tab sends one raw
  prompt and shows the JSON response.
- **Models** — library with VRAM fit checks, download queue, checksum status.
- **Logs** — unified log stream across backends, gateway, and the app, with
  level filtering and a diagnostic-bundle export.
- **Gateway** — routing rules (pattern → model group → backends), strategies
  (simple-shuffle, least-busy, latency-based), OpenRouter cloud tier and
  fallback policy.
- **Settings / MXC** — application settings, MXC policy editor with
  Learning-mode activity reports, credential references, update checks.

## Daily workflow

1. Glance at the Dashboard: all services green, GPUs nominal.
2. After a Learning-mode period, review the MXC activity report and tighten
   the policy (Settings / MXC).
3. Model updates appear in Models with changelogs; updating re-runs the
   checksum and a smoke test automatically.
4. Anything looks wrong → Logs filtered to the service, or Re-run audit for
   a full verification pass.

## Where things live

- Application: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Local LLM Service Manager`
- Config and logs: `%APPDATA%\llm-manager`
- Models: `%APPDATA%\llm-manager\models` (configurable in Settings)
- llama.cpp builds: `%APPDATA%\llm-manager\bin`

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Where to look |
|---|---|
| Backend won't start | Backend detail → flags and last log lines; Logs filtered to the backend |
| GPU shows STALE | Telemetry lost the GPU — check `nvidia-smi` in a terminal; reseat/driver issue if absent there too |
| Slow responses | Backend detail latency chart; check queue depth and whether the OpenRouter tier is absorbing overflow (Gateway) |
| Tool calls blocked unexpectedly | Settings / MXC → recent decisions; Learning-mode report shows what the policy saw |
| Config corrupted | `%APPDATA%\llm-manager\config.json` is versioned with automatic backup on migration; restore from `config.json.bak` |
| Everything is green but answers are wrong | Backend detail → Test-request tab: bypasses routing and hits the backend directly |
